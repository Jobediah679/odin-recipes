        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <div><p><li>Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a<br>
                large sauce pot. Add then onion and garlic<br>
                and cook about 5 minutes, or until softened<br>
                and translucent. Add the ground beef and sausage,<br>
                and cook 10 minutes over medium heat, stirring<br>
                occasionally. Add the tomatoes, basil, and oregano,<br>
                and stir to combine. Simmer for about 20 minutes.<br>
                Season to taste with salt and pepper, then chill.</li></p>

            <p><li>Make the cheese mixture: Mix together the ricotta,<br>
                mozzarella, and romano cheeses, parsley, salt,<br>
                pepper, basil, oregano, and egg in a large mixing bowl.</li></p>
        
            <p><li>Build and bake the lasagna: Spray the bottom of a<br>
                9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spread<br>
                4 ounces of the meat sauce on the bottom of the pan.<br>
                Layer 3 lasagna noodles over the meat sauce (they may<br>
                overlap slightly). Spread 1 cup of the cheese mixture<br>
                over the noodles. Spread 1 cup of meat sauce onto the<br>
                cheese mixture. Repeat the layers of noodles, cheese,<br>
                and meat sauce two more times. Top with 3 lasagna<br>
                noodles, the remaining meat sauce, and shredded mozzarella.</li></p>

            <p><li>Spray a large piece of foil with cooking spray and<br>
                wrap the pan tightly with it, sprayed side down. Bake<br>
                at 325ยบF for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the internal<br>
                temperature is 165ยบ. Turn the oven off and allow the<br>
                lasagna to set up in the warm oven for 30 minutes.</li></p>

            <p><li>Cut into squares 2 rows long by 4 rows wide.<br>
                Plate and garnish with fresh basil.</li></p>
