        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><li>For the Carne Asada Marinade: In a 1-gallon<br>
                zipper-lock bag, combine orange juice, cilantro,<br>
                garlic, lime juice, olive oil, cumin, oregano,<br>
                chipotle powder, and salt. Seal bag and lightly<br>
                shake to thoroughly combine ingredients.</li></p>
                
            <p><li>Open bag, add steak, then reseal the bag, pressing<br>
                out excess air. Marinate in refrigerator for at<br>
                least 3 and up to 8 hours, turning bag once halfway<br>
                through.</li></p>
                
            <p><li><strong>Meanwhile, for the Beans:</strong> In a<br>
                medium pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over<br>
                medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and<br>
                cook, stirring, util softened and just starting to<br>
                brown, about 6 minutes. Stir in garlic, cumin, and<br>
                bay leaves and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li></p>

            <p><li>Add beans, chicken stock, and a large pinch of salt<br>
                and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a bare<br>
                simmer, cover, and cook until beans are just tender,<br>
                about 2 hours 30 minutes; add water at any point to<br>
                keep beans covered.</li></p>
                
            <p><li>Remove lid and continue cooking, stirring occasionally,<br>
                until beans are very soft and creamy, about 45 minutes<br>
                longer; top up with water as needed to keep beans just<br>
                covered. Once beans are fully softened, allow liquid<br>
                to reduce into a rich, creamy broth. Season with salt,<br>
                if needed. Discard the bay leaves. Leave covered until<br>
                ready to serve, or transfer to an airtight container<br>
                and refrigerate until ready to use; reheat before using.</li></p>
                
            <p><li><strong>For the Rice:</strong> In a medium pot or<br>
                Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat<br>
                until shimmering. Add rice and cook, stirring<br>
                constantly, until very lightly toasted, about 2<br>
                minutes. Stir in onion and garlic and cook, stirring,<br>
                until onion is just starting to soften and lightly<br>
                brown, about 4 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook<br>
                until slightly darkened, about 1 minute.</li></p>
                
            <p><li>Add chicken stock and bring to boil. Reduce heat to<br>
                bare simmer, cover, and cook for 15 minutes without<br>
                disturbing. Remove from heat and let stand, covered,<br>
                for 10 minutes. Uncover rice and gently fluff with a<br>
                fork. Cover and keep warm until ready to use.</li></p>
                
            <p><li><strong>To Cook Carne Asada and Assemble Burritos:</strong><br>
                Remove skirt steak from marinade and blot dry. Light<br>
                one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal<br>
                is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange<br>
                the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set<br>
                cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to<br>
                preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the<br>
                burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting,<br>
                cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil<br>
                the grilling grate. (For directions using a skillet,<br>
                see note.)</li></p>
                
            <p><li>Place steak directly over the hot side of the grill.<br>
                If using a gas grill, cover; if using a charcoal grill,<br>
                leave open. Cook, turning occasionally, until steak<br>
                is well charred on outside and center registers 120°F<br>
                (50°C) on an instant-read thermometer, 5 to 10 minutes<br>
                total.</li></p>
                
            <p><li>Transfer skirt steak to a cutting board and allow to<br>
                rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly against the grain<br>
                into 1/2-inch-thick slices, then cross-cut the slices<br>
                into 1/2-inch cubes.</li></p>
                
            <p><li>Working 1 tortilla at a time and using a pastry brush,<br>
                lightly brush tortilla all over on one side with water.<br>
                In a dry nonstick pan, warm tortilla, wet side down,<br>
                over medium heat until warmed on first side and excess<br>
                water has cooked off. Brush top side with water, then<br>
                flip tortilla, add a generous sprinkle of cheese all<br>
                over, and cook until cheese begins to melt. Transfer<br>
                tortilla to a clean work surface.</li></p>

            <p><li>Being careful not to overfill, spread an even layer<br>
                of rice on top of tortilla, leaving at least 2 inches<br>
                of border on either side and at least 3 inches of<br>
                border above and below. Spoon beans on top of rice,<br>
                followed by additional cheese, then the carne asada,<br>
                guacamole, pico de gallo, and sour cream. Fold the<br>
                tortilla sides in over the filling. Then roll the<br>
                bottom flap of tortilla up over the filling, holding<br>
                the sides tight as you roll. Continue rolling until<br>
                the burrito is sealed. Wrap in foil for a tighter hold.<br>
                Repeat with remaining tortillas and fillings, wiping<br>
                out skillet between uses. Serve right away.</li></p>
