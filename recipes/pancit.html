        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is another one of those<br>
            dishes that you can have any<br>
            day of the year whether it be<br>
            a hot summer day or a cold one.</p>
        <p>The beauty of this recipe is there<br>
            is no right way to make it. Each<br>
            family has their own little touch<br>
            they like to add to it. This recipe<br>
            serves 6 people and it takes 10<br>
            minutes to prep and 20 minutes<br>
            to cook.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <p><li>8 oz pancit canton/dried egg<br>
                noodles (find the Filipino<br>
                variety labeled as such, if<br>
                possible)</li></p>
            <p><li>1 lb pork belly or pork tenderloin<br>
                (pork is the common meat used<br>
                with pancit canton but you can<br>
                use chicken or shrimp or a combo<br>
                of each)</li></p>
            <p><li>2 tbsp soy sauce<br>
                (regular seasoning soy sauce)</li></p>
            <p><li>1 tbsp oyster sauce (you may use<br>
                the mushroom version if you<br>
                want to make this meatless)</li></p>
            <p><li>1 tbsp brown sugar (just a little<br>
                to help enhance the flavor<br>
                of the seasoning sauce)</li></p>
            <p><li>1 tbsp cooking oil</li></p>   
            <p><li>1 shallots (traditional) or onion</li></p>
            <p><li>4 garlic cloves</li></p>
            <p><li>2 cups chicken broth or chicken<br>
                stock (water may also be<br>
                used as replacement)</li></p>
            <p><li>1 cup carrots</li></p>
            <p><li>1 cup cabbage</li></p>
            <p><li>1 cup green beans (you may use<br>
                other vegetables, too)</li></p>
            <p><li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li></p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <p><li>In a bowl, mix together<br>
                the chicken broth, soy sauce,<br>
                oyster sauce and sugar. Set aside.</li></p>
            <p><li>Heat a little oil (about<br>
                1 tablespoon) in a wok or<br>
                large skillet. If using pork<br>
                belly, which has some fat,<br>
                no need to add any oil as it<br>
                would render its own fat so<br>
                simply heat them up in the wok<br>
                or skillet. Season with a<br>
                little salt and pepper. Cook<br>
                until the meat has turned<br>
                nicely browned and released<br>
                some fat (I cook until they<br>
                are a bit crispy for more flavor).</li></p>
            <p><li>Add the garlic and shallot<br>
                and saute until shallots have<br>
                browned a little. Add the rest<br>
                of the vegetables â€“ carrots,<br>
                green beans, cabbage. etc. and<br>
                saute for another 2-3 minutes or<br>
                until crisp-tender. Pour in the<br>
                seasoned broth and bring to a boil.</li></p>
            <p><li>When it begins to boil<br>
                add the egg noodles. Press<br>
                and fold the noodles a few<br>
                times to ensure it gets soaked<br>
                in the sauce. Continue to<br>
                stir and fold the noodles<br>
                while trying to soak them<br>
                in the sauce until all the<br>
                liquid has dried up and the<br>
                noodles are tender.</li></p>
            <p><li>Taste and adjust seasoning,<br>
                if needed. Serve immediately.</li></p>
        </ol>
